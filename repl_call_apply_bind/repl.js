//5. REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)
//REPL is an interactive programming environment that takes user inputs (Read), 
//evaluates them (Eval), prints the result (Print), and then waits
// for the next input (Loop). In JavaScript, Node.js provides a REPL environment.

//Example:

//In a Node.js environment, you can start the REPL by typing node in the terminal
const x=9;
x*=5;
//REPL is useful for quickly testing JavaScript code snippets and 
//experimenting with language features.
